Begrippen

-	Instruction list (IL): a list of elementary (atomic) expressions which can be executed by a certain CPU. For example, x86 (used in personal computers) and arm (used in mobile devices) processors have different and incompatible instruction lists.

-	Source code: a text encoded in any of the programming languages (regardless of the language's level).

-	Trigraphs: ''' or """ (for multi-line strings).

-	Unary operator: an operator with only one operand (+, -).

-	Binary operator: an operator with two operands.

-	Left-sided binding/right-side binding: when operators are evaluated from left to right, or the other way around.

-	Python's keywords (or reserved words).

-	Type casting: an operation during which the data changes its type.

-	Control variable: 

-	Initializing parameters: default values, postional, or by keyword

-	Scope: a part of the code where a certain name is properly recognizable.

-	Unit testing: programming technique in which tests and test data are created before the code is  written or created in parallel with the code.



Every language has an alphabet, a lexis (dictionary), a syntax and a semantics

Source code can be translated to machine code via two techniques:
a) compilation - one-time translation, a binary file is created, the code is not automatically run, done by a compiler or translator;

b) interpretation - on-the-fly translation, the code is also run, done by a interpreter.
